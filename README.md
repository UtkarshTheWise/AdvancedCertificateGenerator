# AdvancedCertificateGenerator
This is my first solo Python Project YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Open sourced :) Please feel free to make improvements.

You can either run main.py after installing the dependencies or straight away use the executable.

# Size
Change Canvas Size according to your size of certificate, currently it is fixed at A4 Size at 96 DPI. (Good Enough for prints) 

# Certificate Name
The Name of the certificate is taken from the last textbox / file added. 

# Font
Some basic fonts are included in Fonts folder, you can add your own using the add custom font button or by adding them into the fonts folder and adding it in the Known_fonts list at the start. Ensure fonts are only true type (tff)
